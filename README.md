This tool was created using Grok. The purpose of this example is to demonstrate coding with AI. 

The code in the repository has been entirely generated by AI and has not been modified by me. I provided the requirements, used the generated code, and when I encountered issues, I described the problems in the chat and requested solutions.

This tool is designed to take a large file and divide it into smaller files.
